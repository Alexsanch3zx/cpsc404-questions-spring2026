# Week 10: Dual Reading — Hierarchy vs. Governance

**Due:** Wednesday, March 25, 2026 at 11:59 PM

## Readings

1. **Help Your Boss Help You** — Chapter 7: Managing the Chain of Command
2. **Producing Open Source Software** — Chapter 4: Social and Political Infrastructure
   - Free online: https://producingoss.com/en/social-infrastructure.html

## Theme: How Decisions Get Made

Both chapters address organizational structure and decision-making—but the models are fundamentally different:

| HYBHY (Corporate) | ProducingOSS (Open Source) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Chain of command is explicit | Governance emerges from contribution |
| Skip-level meetings are delicate | "Forkability" as ultimate check on power |
| HR and formal processes | Consensus, voting, or benevolent dictator |
| Authority flows from position | Authority flows from respect and track record |
| Going over your boss's head is risky | Transparent discussion is the norm |

## This Week's Assignment

**Submit ONE question that bridges both readings.**

Your question should explore how organizational structure, authority, and decision-making work differently (or similarly) in corporate hierarchies versus open source governance models.

### Strong questions might explore:

- What's the open source equivalent of "going over your boss's head"? Is it even possible?
- How does "forkability" change the power dynamics compared to corporate employment?
- Can benevolent dictator governance scale? How does it compare to corporate leadership?
- What happens when corporate-sponsored developers participate in community-governed projects?
- How do you "manage up" when the chain of command is informal or nonexistent?
- When do open source projects need more formal governance, and what triggers that shift?

### Avoid:

- Questions that only reference one book
- Generic questions about leadership that don't engage specific chapter concepts
