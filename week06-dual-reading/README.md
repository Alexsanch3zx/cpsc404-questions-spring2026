# Week 6: Dual Reading — Responsibility With and Without Authority

**Due:** Wednesday, February 25, 2026 at 11:59 PM

## Readings

1. **Help Your Boss Help You** — Chapter 4: Sending the Important Two Messages
2. **Producing Open Source Software** — Chapter 8: Managing Participants
   - Free online: https://producingoss.com/en/managing-participants.html

## Theme: Taking Responsibility

Both chapters address how to demonstrate competence and earn trust—but in very different contexts:

| HYBHY (Corporate) | ProducingOSS (Open Source) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "I Got This" — taking ownership | Earning commit access through contribution |
| "I Got Your Back" — team loyalty | Building reputation without formal authority |
| Formal hierarchy grants authority | Authority earned through demonstrated competence |
| Private conversations with boss | Public record of all contributions |

## This Week's Assignment

**Submit ONE question that bridges both readings.**

Your question should explore how responsibility, trust, or influence work differently (or similarly) in hierarchical workplaces versus open source communities.

### Strong questions might explore:

- How do "I Got This" signals translate to open source? What's the equivalent?
- What does "managing participants" look like without formal authority to hire/fire?
- How is trust built differently when all your work is public vs. private?
- Can the "Two Messages" framework apply to open source maintainers?
- What happens when corporate employees contribute to open source—which model applies?

### Avoid:

- Questions that only reference one book
- Generic questions that could be asked without reading either chapter

## Submission

Create a file named `lastname-firstname.md` in the `questions/` folder.

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for detailed Git workflow instructions.
