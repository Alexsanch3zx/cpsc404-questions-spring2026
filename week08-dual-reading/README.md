**Due:** Wednesday, March 11, 2026 at 11:59 PM

2. **Producing Open Source Software** — Chapter 6: Communications
   - Free online: https://producingoss.com/en/communications.html

## Theme: How We Communicate

Both chapters focus on effective communication—but the contexts create very different constraints:

| HYBHY (Corporate) | ProducingOSS (Open Source) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Face-to-face and real-time emphasis | Asynchronous and written by default |
| Private channels (1:1s, closed meetings) | Public mailing lists, issue trackers |
| Personality types (Keirsey/MBTI) shape approach | Tone and clarity matter more than style |
| Building rapport through interaction | Building trust through transparent archives |
| Communication supports hierarchy | Communication *is* the project structure |

## This Week's Assignment

**Submit ONE question that bridges both readings.**

Your question should explore how communication works differently (or similarly) when you're in a corporate hierarchy versus an open source community.

### Strong questions might explore:

- How does the advice to adapt to your boss's communication style apply (or not) in open source?
- What are the trade-offs between synchronous rapport-building and asynchronous transparency?
- How do personality frameworks (like Keirsey) help or hinder in communities you've never met in person?
- When should open source projects use real-time communication (Slack, Discord) vs. async (mailing lists, issues)?
- How does "managing up" translate when there's no formal "up"?

### Avoid:

- Questions that only reference one book
- Generic questions about communication that don't engage specific chapter concepts
